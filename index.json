It was lead by Nadia Steiber, Monika Mühlböck, and Bernhard Kittel and cooperated with the Austrian ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection (BMASK) and the Austrian Public Employment Service (AMS). Project members included Stefan Vogtenhuber, Stefanie Stadlober, and myself. The project aimed to study the heterogeneous consequences of becoming unemployed in an early age. Study results have been featured in several Austrian media outlets(e.g. @FM4)\nThe project consisted of three main parts: 1) An initial quantitative survey at the beginning of an unemployment spell (N~1500) combined with a accompanying qualitative study investigating the subjective experience of 36 unemployed young adults in Vienna. 2) A follow up survey one year later of those participating in wave one. This panel survey data was also merged with governmental registry data about details in changes in the labor market status in the past year (this data also included information on registered attempts to apply for a job or participation in state-aided training programmes). 3) A field experiment featuring a small motivational nudge delivered via E-Mail to test the effect of information and externally induced self-reflection on job uptake and unemployment duration.\nI joined the project 2018 and had the opportunity to work on the survey and video that contained the main treatments of the field experiment of module 3 of the project. We developed a survey using soscisurvey.de presenting either a short video, a survey or both to roughly 20.000 individuals who got recently unemployed in Austria. Invitations to participate in the survey or to watch the short informational video with tips to improve job search strategies have been send via E-Mail. As the content (survey/video/both) was included in the invitation mail and treatment allocation was randomized we could test whether a nonmaterial incentive in form of a short video would improve survey response rates or reduces response bias - it does not.\nSix months after sending out the interventions we linked response data to job registry data to test the effect of the treatments. We find that the treatment combining reflection and information reduces job search duration of young unemployed people with a low level of formal education.

In particular, we assume that subjective perceptions of inequity and not objective deviations from equality are crucial to understanding how individuals react to inequality. The paper formalizes these insights by adapting the Fehr and Schmidt (1999) model of inequity aversion replacing the fairness frame of objective equality with subjectively perceived equity. We test this model using data from the European Social Survey 2018 analyzing the association between respondents' perceived fairness of own, top, and bottom incomes with subjective well-being and preferences for redistribution. Results from spline regressions with country-fixed effects indicate that perceived injustice of own and top incomes is positively related to individuals' subjective well-being. For the perceived injustice of bottom incomes, we find no substantive relationships with subjective well-being. Further analyses indicate a positive link between the perceived injustice of bottom and top incomes and preferences for redistribution. In sum, our results suggest that injustice perceived for oneself is connected to utility while perceived injustice of others is related to increased willingness to back redistributive policy proposals even if they are not in line with material self-interest.","tags":["\"and Mobility\"","\"Economic Sociology\"","\"Economics\"","\"Fairness\"","\"Inequality\"","\"Inequity aversion\"","\"Poverty\"","\"Redistribution\"","\"Social and Behavioral Sciences\"","\"Sociology\"","\"Subjective well-being\""],"title":"Subjective Inequity Aversion: Unfair Inequality, Subjective Well-Being, and Preferences for Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Kalleitner","David W Schiestl","Georg Heiler"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674560872,"objectID":"75fe6d8d70899f7b31757e9fa790b32a","permalink":"https://fabiankal.github.io/publication/kalleitner-2022-a/","publishdate":"2023-01-24T11:50:54.075967Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalleitner-2022-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Human mobility has become a major variable of interest during the COVID-19 pandemic and central to policy decisions all around the world. To measure individual mobility, research relies on a variety of indicators that commonly stem from two main data sources: survey self-reports and behavioral mobility data from mobile phones. However, little is known about how mobility from survey self-reports relates to popular mobility estimates using data from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Spanning March 2020 until April 2021, this study compares self-reported mobility from a panel survey in Austria to aggregated mobility estimates utilizing (1) GSM data and (2) Google’s GPS-based Community Mobility Reports. Our analyses show that correlations in mobility changes over time are high, both in general and when comparing subgroups by age, gender, and mobility category. However, while these trends are similar, the size of relative mobility changes over time differs substantially between different mobility estimates. Overall, while our findings suggest that these mobility estimates manage to capture similar latent variables, especially when focusing on changes in mobility over time, researchers should be aware of the specific form of mobility different data sources capture.","tags":[],"title":"Varieties of Mobility Measures: Comparing Survey and Mobile Phone Data during the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Mühlböck","Fabian Kalleitner","Nadia Steiber","Bernhard Kittel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674560871,"objectID":"d577124db5b6094c1b2e5f66e17e5e36","permalink":"https://fabiankal.github.io/publication/muhlbock-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-24T11:50:53.690053Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muhlbock-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Monika Mühlböck, Fabian Kalleitner, Nadia Steiber, Bernhard Kittel","tags":[],"title":"Scarring Dreams?

Researchers have developed novel approaches to increase respondents’ likelihood of participating in web surveys. However, we lack information about whether these methods indeed increase response rates and, if so, whether they bias the resulting data. This article focuses on the use of nonmaterial incentives in the form of a video that provides the invitees with information tailored to their life situation. Analysis of our experimental data shows that instead of increasing respondents’ probability of starting the survey, the video treatments actually decrease it. We provide evidence that the lower salience of the intrinsic benefits of survey participation in the invitation email significantly contributes to this reduction. Additionally, the effect of the nonmaterial incentive differs across subgroups, affecting nonresponse biases in line with employment status, gender, and migration background. We therefore conclude that using additional information in the form of a video as a nonmaterial survey incentive is only suitable under specific conditions.","tags":[],"title":"What’s the Benefit of a Video?

These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using Austrian panel survey data from April 2020 to April 2021, we show that perceived health risks, social norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour. A moderation analysis shows that the effectiveness of social norms in facilitating preventive behaviour increases when people’s perceptions of health risks decrease. No such moderation effect is observed for trust in political institutions. These results suggest that strong social norms play a crucial role in achieving high rates of preventive behaviour, especially when perceived levels of health risks are low.","tags":["\"Surveys\"","\"Behavior\"","\"Behavioral and social aspects of health\"","\"COVID 19\"","\"Pandemics\"","\"Medical risk factors\"","\"Virus testing\"","\"Social theory\""],"title":"Peers for the fearless: Social norms facilitate preventive behaviour when individuals perceive low COVID-19 health risks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Kalleitner","David W.

Financial solidarity within the European Union (EU) could mitigate some of these inequalities but depends upon the support of the citizens of individual member states for such policies. This paper studies attitudes of the Austrian population – a net-contributor to the European budget – towards financial solidarity using two waves of the Austrian Corona Panel Project collected in May and June 2020. We find that individuals (i) who are less likely to consider the Covid-19 pandemic as a national economic threat, (ii) who believe that Austria benefits from supporting other countries, and (iii) who prefer the crisis to be organized more centrally at EU-level show higher support for European financial solidarity. Using fixed effects models, we further show that perceiving economic threats and preferring central crisis management also explain attitude dynamics within individuals over time. We conclude that cost–benefit perceptions are important determinants for individual support of European financial solidarity during the Covid-19 pandemic.","tags":[],"title":"Attitudes towards European financial solidarity during the Covid-19 pandemic: evidence from a net-contributor country","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Kittel","Fabian Kalleitner","David W.

These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using Austrian panel survey data from April to October 2020 we show that perceived health risks, social norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour. Moderation analyses show that the effectiveness of social norms and trust in institutions in facilitating preventive behaviour increases when people's perceptions of health risks decrease. This result suggests that trust in institutions and strong social norms play a crucial role in achieving high rates of preventive behaviour when perceived levels of health risks are low.","tags":["\"Trust\"","\"Sociology\"","\"Covid-19\"","\"SARS-CoV-2\"","\"Social and Behavioral Sciences\"","\"Medical Sociology\"","\"Social Norms\"","\"Institution\"","\"Preventive Behaviour\""],"title":"Avoiding a public health dilemma: Social norms and trust facilitate preventive behaviour if individuals perceive low COVID-19 health risks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Albacete","Pirmin Fessler","Fabian Kalleitner","Peter Lindner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625734868,"objectID":"e30eabce339a0bc46f5b642b3ee6e469","permalink":"https://fabiankal.github.io/publication/albacete-2021/","publishdate":"2023-01-24T11:50:51.799334Z","relpermalink":"/publication/albacete-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"This study discusses the potential effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the finances of households in Austria. Different individuals and households have been exposed to the crisis in very different ways and to varying degrees. In the first part of this study, we discuss different types of households and different channels through which the COVID-19 crisis may affect households’ financial situation. The second part of the study uses data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP) carried out by the University of Vienna as well as data from the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) for Austria to analyze (potential) impacts of the crisis. We find that those households who had already found themselves in a difficult social, economic and financial situation before the COVID-19 crisis were the ones suffering the largest income losses (e.g. low-income households or households with an unemployed reference person).","tags":["\"coronavirus\"","\"Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP)\"","\"COVID-19 crisis\"","\"Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)\""],"title":"How has COVID-19 affected the financial situation of households in Austria?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Kalleitner","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Researchers have developed novel approaches to increase respondents’ likelihood of participating in web surveys. However, we lack information about whether these methods indeed increase response rates and, if so, whether they bias the resulting data. This article focuses on the use of nonmaterial incentives in the form of a video that provides the invitees with information tailored to their life situation. Analysis of our experimental data shows that instead of increasing respondents’ probability of starting the survey, the video treatments actually decrease it. We provide evidence that the lower salience of the intrinsic benefits of survey participation in the invitation email significantly contributes to this reduction. Additionally, the effect of the nonmaterial incentive differs across subgroups, affecting nonresponse biases in line with employment status, gender, and migration background. We therefore conclude that using additional information in the form of a video as a nonmaterial survey incentive is only suitable under specific conditions.","tags":[],"title":"What’s the Benefit of a Video?

We study a core concept of work values, work centrality, and distinguish between an extrinsic dimension, that is, the relative importance of work; and an intrinsic dimension, that is, nonfinancial employment commitment. Using data collected by the CUPESSE project on two generations of families in nine European countries, we explore the congruence of work values between parents and adolescents and the effect of the regional-level social and economic context on young adults’ work values. We find, first, that parental influence is the most robust determinant of extrinsic and intrinsic work centrality in adolescents. Second, the relative importance of work to young women varies across regions, but the variation is explained in part by female labor force participation rates in those regions. Third, differing patterns of extrinsic and intrinsic work centrality across European regions are explained, in part, by gender, education, and subjective financial satisfaction.","tags":["\"Europe\"","\"work values\"","\"labor force participation\"","\"regions\"","\"intergenerational transmission\"","\"multilevel analysis\"","\"employment commitment\""],"title":"The Transmission of Work Centrality within the Family in a Cross-Regional Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?
