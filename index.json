It was lead by Nadia Steiber, Monika Mühlböck, and Bernhard Kittel and cooperated with the Austrian ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection (BMASK) and the Austrian Public Employment Service (AMS). Project members included Stefan Vogtenhuber, Stefanie Stadlober, and myself. The project aimed to study the heterogeneous consequences of becoming unemployed in an early age. Study results have been featured in several Austrian media outlets(e.g. @FM4)\nThe project consisted of three main parts: 1) An initial quantitative survey at the beginning of an unemployment spell (N~1500) combined with a accompanying qualitative study investigating the subjective experience of 36 unemployed young adults in Vienna. 2) A follow up survey one year later of those participating in wave one. This panel survey data was also merged with governmental registry data about details in changes in the labor market status in the past year (this data also included information on registered attempts to apply for a job or participation in state-aided training programmes). 3) A field experiment featuring a small motivational nudge delivered via E-Mail to test the effect of information and externally induced self-reflection on job uptake and unemployment duration.\nI joined the project 2018 and had the opportunity to work on the survey and video that contained the main treatments of the field experiment of module 3 of the project. We developed a survey using soscisurvey.de presenting either a short video, a survey or both to roughly 20.000 individuals who got recently unemployed in Austria. Invitations to participate in the survey or to watch the short informational video with tips to improve job search strategies have been send via E-Mail. As the content (survey/video/both) was included in the invitation mail and treatment allocation was randomized we could test whether a nonmaterial incentive in form of a short video would improve survey response rates or reduces response bias - it does not.\nSix months after sending out the interventions we linked response data to job registry data to test the effect of the treatments. We find that the treatment combining reflection and information reduces job search duration of young unemployed people with a low level of formal education.

Such schemes increase the number of welfare recipients but could also lead to increased competition among different types of welfare claimants. We draw on data from an online panel survey fielded in Austria during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) to study individual preferences for financially supporting both short-time workers and the unemployed. We find that individuals prefer higher welfare benefits for low-income recipients and for those on short-time work compared to high-income recipients and those in unemployment. While we find cross-sectionally that these differences are related to individuals’ socio-economic position, we do not find longitudinal evidence that people adapt their preferences following switches in and out of different benefit programmes. Focusing on social beliefs as drivers of preferences, we find that negative attitudes towards the unemployed decrease preferences targeted at low income-earners. We conclude that long-term individual characteristics and attitudes rather than short-term changes in circumstances remain central to explaining benefit preferences under a dualised welfare regime during a labour-market crisis.","tags":[],"title":"How much for whom?

Such income-stratified tax preferences can result from differences in preferences of what should be taxed as argued by previous literature. However, it may also result from income-stratified perceptions of what is taxed. This paper argues that the rich perceive higher levels of tax progressivity than the poor and that tax perceptions affect individuals' support for progressive taxation. Using data from an Austrian survey experiment, we test this argument in three steps: First, in line with past research, we show that individuals' income positions are connected to individuals' tax preferences as a self-interest rationale would predict. However, second, we show that this variation is mainly driven by income-stratified tax perceptions. Third, randomly informing a subset of the sample about actual tax rates, we find that changing tax perceptions causally affects support for redistributive taxation among those who initially overestimated the level of tax progressivity. Our results indicate that tax perceptions are relevant for forming tax preferences and suggest that individuals are more polarized in their perceptions of who pays how much taxes than in their support for who should pay how much tax.","tags":[],"title":"Taxed Fairly?

In particular, we assume that subjective perceptions of inequity and not objective deviations from equality are crucial to understanding how individuals react to inequality. The paper formalizes these insights by adapting the Fehr and Schmidt (1999) model of inequity aversion replacing the fairness frame of objective equality with subjectively perceived equity. We test this model using data from the European Social Survey 2018 analyzing the association between respondents' perceived fairness of own, top, and bottom incomes with subjective well-being and preferences for redistribution. Results from spline regressions with country-fixed effects indicate that perceived injustice of own and top incomes is positively related to individuals' subjective well-being. For the perceived injustice of bottom incomes, we find no substantive relationships with subjective well-being. Further analyses indicate a positive link between the perceived injustice of bottom and top incomes and preferences for redistribution. In sum, our results suggest that injustice perceived for oneself is connected to utility while perceived injustice of others is related to increased willingness to back redistributive policy proposals even if they are not in line with material self-interest.","tags":["\"and Mobility\"","\"Economic Sociology\"","\"Economics\"","\"Fairness\"","\"Inequality\"","\"Inequity aversion\"","\"Poverty\"","\"Redistribution\"","\"Social and Behavioral Sciences\"","\"Sociology\"","\"Subjective well-being\""],"title":"Subjective Inequity Aversion: Unfair Inequality, Subjective Well-Being, and Preferences for Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Kalleitner","Sandra Bohmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696420474,"objectID":"46c3c1dd2ce9600a66aec8a1238c7376","permalink":"https://fabiankal.github.io/publication/kalleitner-2023/","publishdate":"2024-10-25T09:19:55.477513Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalleitner-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Using data from the European Social Survey, we examine income fairness evaluations of 17,605 respondents from 28 countries.

To measure individual mobility, research relies on a variety of indicators that commonly stem from two main data sources: survey self-reports and behavioral mobility data from mobile phones. However, little is known about how mobility from survey self-reports relates to popular mobility estimates using data from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Spanning March 2020 until April 2021, this study compares self-reported mobility from a panel survey in Austria to aggregated mobility estimates utilizing (1) GSM data and (2) Google's GPS-based Community Mobility Reports. Our analyses show that correlations in mobility changes over time are high, both in general and when comparing subgroups by age, gender, and mobility category. However, while these trends are similar, the size of relative mobility changes over time differs substantially between different mobility estimates. Overall, while our findings suggest that these mobility estimates manage to capture similar latent variables, especially when focusing on changes in mobility over time, researchers should be aware of the specific form of mobility different data sources capture.","tags":[],"title":"Varieties of Mobility Measures: Comparing Survey and Mobile Phone Data during the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Mühlböck","Fabian Kalleitner","Nadia Steiber","Bernhard Kittel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674560871,"objectID":"d577124db5b6094c1b2e5f66e17e5e36","permalink":"https://fabiankal.github.io/publication/muhlbock-2022/","publishdate":"2024-10-25T09:19:59.402322Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muhlbock-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Young people's early-career unemployment experience has been found to have long-lasting effects, resulting in lower earnings even decades later. However, while this so-called ``scarring effect'' is well established, there is still little knowledge about the mechanisms through which it comes about. We take a closer look at the period that produces the wounds that later turn to scars. Drawing on a panel survey in which young adults in Austria were interviewed once at the beginning of an unemployment period and again one year later, we study how job aspirations and expectations changed during this period. We find that respondents on average lowered their aspirations and expectations over time, particularly those who experienced latent deprivation during unemployment. Furthermore, while the aspirations and expectations of those who were unemployed at the time of the second interview remained relatively unchanged, those who were employed lowered their expectations and to some extent also their aspirations. Our results suggest that research should pay more attention to the heterogenous effects of early-career unemployment: It produces scarred dreams for some while others manage to keep their aspirations and expectations alive.","tags":[],"title":"Scarring Dreams?

Researchers have developed novel approaches to increase respondents' likelihood of participating in web surveys. However, we lack information about whether these methods indeed increase response rates and, if so, whether they bias the resulting data. This article focuses on the use of nonmaterial incentives in the form of a video that provides the invitees with information tailored to their life situation. Analysis of our experimental data shows that instead of increasing respondents' probability of starting the survey, the video treatments actually decrease it. We provide evidence that the lower salience of the intrinsic benefits of survey participation in the invitation email significantly contributes to this reduction. Additionally, the effect of the nonmaterial incentive differs across subgroups, affecting nonresponse biases in line with employment status, gender, and migration background. We therefore conclude that using additional information in the form of a video as a nonmaterial survey incentive is only suitable under specific conditions.","tags":[],"title":"What's the Benefit of a Video?

These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using Austrian panel survey data from April 2020 to April 2021, we show that perceived health risks, social norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour. A moderation analysis shows that the effectiveness of social norms in facilitating preventive behaviour increases when people's perceptions of health risks decrease. No such moderation effect is observed for trust in political institutions. These results suggest that strong social norms play a crucial role in achieving high rates of preventive behaviour, especially when perceived levels of health risks are low.","tags":["\"Behavior\"","\"Behavioral and social aspects of health\"","\"COVID 19\"","\"Medical risk factors\"","\"Pandemics\"","\"Social theory\"","\"Surveys\"","\"Virus testing\""],"title":"Peers for the Fearless: Social Norms Facilitate Preventive Behaviour When Individuals Perceive Low COVID-19 Health Risks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabian Kalleitner","David W.

To evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts scientific research relies on a variety of mobility measures that commonly stem from two main data sources: survey-self-reports and behavioral mobility data from mobile phones. However, little is known about how mobility from survey self-reports relates to popular mobility estimates using GSM and GPS data. Spanning March 2020 until April 2021 this study compares self-reported mobility from a panel survey in Austria to aggregated mobility estimates utilizing (i) GSM data and (ii) Google's Community Mobility Reports. Our analyses show that correlations in mobility changes over time are high, both in general and when comparing different subgroups. Differences emerge if subgroup differences are compared between mobility estimates. Overall, our findings suggest that these mobility measures manage to capture similar latent variables but researchers should be aware of the specific form of mobility different data sources measure.","tags":["\"Austria\"","\"Big data\"","\"COVID-19\"","\"Methodology\"","\"Mobility\"","\"Panel and other longitudianl studies\"","\"Social and Behavioral Sciences\"","\"Sociology\"","\"Survey Research\""],"title":"Varieties of Mobility Measures: Comparing Survey and Mobile Phone Data during the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Mühlböck","Fabian Kalleitner","Nadia Steiber","Bernhard Kittel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625734872,"objectID":"5d462e535bd1265fdc17dd9d0ffb0a32","permalink":"https://fabiankal.github.io/publication/muhlbock-2021/","publishdate":"2024-10-25T09:19:58.971074Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muhlbock-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Jobseekers, especially young people with little experience on the job market, face several challenges. They need to know which jobs are suited for them, where to find them, how to apply, and they need resilience in the face of repeated rejections. Previous research has shown that receiving information and reflecting on how to search for a job enhance self-efficacy and search motivation, thereby reducing the duration of unemployment spells. Following up on these results, we conducted an experiment in cooperation with the Austrian Ministry of Social Affairs which combines an ``information nudge'' in the form of a short video-clip with what we call ``reflection nudge'' in the form of an online survey. We find that a treatment combining reflection and information reduces job search duration of young unemployed people with a low level of formal education. Considering the low costs of the intervention, efficiency is very high.","tags":[],"title":"Information, Reflection, and Successful Job Search: A Labor Market Policy Experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Kittel","Sylvia Kritzinger","Hajo Boomgaarden","Barbara Prainsack","Jakob-Moritz Eberl","Fabian Kalleitner","Noëlle S.

ACPP has been designed to capture the social, political, and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the Austrian population on a weekly basis. The thematic scope of the study covers several core dimensions related to the individual and societal impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The panel survey has a sample size of approximately 1500 respondents per wave. It contains questions that are asked every week, complemented by domain-specific modules to explore specific topics in more detail.

Financial solidarity within the European Union (EU) could mitigate some of these inequalities but depends upon the support of the citizens of individual member states for such policies. This paper studies attitudes of the Austrian population – a net-contributor to the European budget – towards financial solidarity using two waves of the Austrian Corona Panel Project collected in May and June 2020. We find that individuals (i) who are less likely to consider the Covid-19 pandemic as a national economic threat, (ii) who believe that Austria benefits from supporting other countries, and (iii) who prefer the crisis to be organized more centrally at EU-level show higher support for European financial solidarity. Using fixed effects models, we further show that perceiving economic threats and preferring central crisis management also explain attitude dynamics within individuals over time. We conclude that cost– benefit perceptions are important determinants for individual support of European financial solidarity during the Covid-19 pandemic.","tags":[],"title":"Attitudes towards European Financial Solidarity during the Covid-19 Pandemic: Evidence from a Net-Contributor Country","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Kittel","Fabian Kalleitner","David W.

These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using Austrian panel survey data from April to October 2020 we show that perceived health risks, social norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour. Moderation analyses show that the effectiveness of social norms and trust in institutions in facilitating preventive behaviour increases when people's perceptions of health risks decrease.

We study a core concept of work values, work centrality, and distinguish between an extrinsic dimension, that is, the relative importance of work; and an intrinsic dimension, that is, nonfinancial employment commitment. Using data collected by the CUPESSE project on two generations of families in nine European countries, we explore the congruence of work values between parents and adolescents and the effect of the regional-level social and economic context on young adults' work values. We find, first, that parental influence is the most robust determinant of extrinsic and intrinsic work centrality in adolescents. Second, the relative importance of work to young women varies across regions, but the variation is explained in part by female labor force participation rates in those regions. Third, differing patterns of extrinsic and intrinsic work centrality across European regions are explained, in part, by gender, education, and subjective financial satisfaction.","tags":["\"employment commitment\"","\"Europe\"","\"intergenerational transmission\"","\"labor force participation\"","\"multilevel analysis\"","\"regions\"","\"work values\""],"title":"The Transmission of Work Centrality within the Family in a Cross-Regional Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?
